## Description:
The workout tracker app creates a Mongo database using a Mongoose schema. Routes are handled by Express.

## Installation:
    npm install

Then run in terminal

    npm start

## Usage:
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

Here is the landing page:

The user either continues adding exercises to an existing workout or starts are new one. This is the screen for adding a new resistence workout:
